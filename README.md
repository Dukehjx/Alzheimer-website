# üåç AI-Powered Platform for Early Detection of MCI & Alzheimer's Prevention

Welcome to our innovative platform designed to facilitate early detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and support Alzheimer's prevention through AI-driven tools and resources. This project combines advanced language analysis, cognitive training, and comprehensive resources to promote cognitive health.

## üß† Core Features

### 1. AI-Powered MCI & Alzheimer's Early Screening

- **AI Language Analysis**: Users can submit speech or text samples, which our AI analyzes to assess potential cognitive decline by examining linguistic patterns.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Receive immediate risk scores based on factors like vocabulary richness, sentence complexity, and fluency.
- **Data Tracking**: Monitor language trends over time to identify early signs of cognitive decline.

### 2. Alzheimer's Prevention & Cognitive Training

- **Daily Cognitive Training Games**: Engage in AI-generated language-based challenges, such as word recall and reading comprehension, to strengthen cognitive abilities.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Obtain AI-driven, customized prevention plans tailored to individual cognitive profiles.
- **Lifestyle & Health Guidelines**: Access evidence-based strategies for diet, exercise, sleep, and social interaction to slow cognitive decline.

### 3. Resource Hub

- **Alzheimer's Knowledge Base**: Explore comprehensive information on early symptoms, prevention strategies, and caregiving tips.
- **Latest Research Updates**: Stay informed with AI-curated articles on new findings in Alzheimer's treatment and prevention.
- **Community Support Forum**: Connect with patients, caregivers, and researchers to exchange insights and experiences.

### 4. Lightweight Health Monitoring

- **Speech Recordings & Progress Tracking**: Periodically record speech to monitor cognitive changes over time.
- **Doctor/Researcher Collaboration (Optional)**: Share data with medical professionals or researchers to support studies on cognitive health.

## üõ† Technical Implementation

- **Functions**:
  - Speech-to-Text Conversion using OpenAI's Whisper API
  - NLP-Based Language Analysis with spaCy or GPT-4
  - AI Risk Scoring Model utilizing Scikit-learn
  - User Data Storage & Progress Tracking with MongoDB or SQLite

### 3. AI-Powered Language Analysis

- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Integrate OpenAI's Whisper API for accurate transcription.
- **NLP Feature Extraction**:
  - Measure lexical diversity to assess vocabulary richness.
  - Perform dependency parsing with spaCy to evaluate sentence complexity.
  - Track hesitations and repetitions to analyze fluency and pause patterns.
- **ML-Based Cognitive Risk Scoring**: Train models using Alzheimer's language datasets to provide reliable risk assessments.

## üéØ Project Highlights
