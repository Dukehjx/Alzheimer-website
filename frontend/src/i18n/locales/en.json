Younger individuals may initially be misdiagnosed due to atypical symptoms like vision or language problems rather than memory issues."

Some remain stable for years, and a portion may even revert to normal cognition, especially if the cause is treatable (e.g., medication side effects, depression, or sleep disorders)."

Lifestyle changes, cognitive activities, and social support are also crucial non-pharmacological interventions."
