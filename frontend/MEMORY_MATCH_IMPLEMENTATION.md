```

### Key Components

#### 1. Game Data (`memoryMatchData.js`)
- **DIFFICULTY_LEVELS**: Configuration for 5 difficulty levels
- **QUESTION_ANSWER_PAIRS**: 200 Q&A pairs across categories:
  - Geography & Capitals (50 pairs)
  - Simple Math & Number Facts (50 pairs)
  - General Knowledge & Everyday Facts (50 pairs)
  - Vocabulary (Synonyms & Antonyms) (50 pairs)
- **Utility Functions**: Card creation, scoring, and feedback generation

#### 2. Main Game Component (`MemoryMatchGame.jsx`)
- **Game States**: Setup, Playing, Paused, Completed
- **Card Management**: Flip logic, match detection, animation handling
- **Scoring System**: Time and move-based scoring with bonuses
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time statistics and performance metrics

#### 3. Styling (`index.css`)
- **3D Card Animations**: CSS transforms for realistic card flipping
- **Match/Mismatch Feedback**: Visual animations for game events
- **Responsive Grid**: Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Focus indicators and high contrast support

### Game Logic

#### Card Matching Algorithm
```javascript
const checkForMatch = (firstCard, secondCard) => {
  const isMatch = firstCard.pairId === secondCard.pairId;
  
  if (isMatch) {
    // Mark cards as matched
    // Add match animation
    // Update score
  } else {
    // Deduct life (challenge mode)
    // Add shake animation
    // Flip cards back after delay
  }
};
```

#### Scoring System
```javascript
const calculateScore = (totalPairs, movesUsed, timeElapsed, difficulty) => {
  const idealMoves = DIFFICULTY_LEVELS[difficulty].idealMoves;
  const timeBonusThreshold = DIFFICULTY_LEVELS[difficulty].timeBonus;
  
  const timePenalty = timeElapsed * 5;
  const movePenalty = Math.max(0, (movesUsed - idealMoves)) * 50;
  
  let score = 10000 - (timePenalty + movePenalty);
  
  // Apply bonuses
  if (timeElapsed <= timeBonusThreshold) score += 500;
  if (movesUsed <= idealMoves) score += 1000;
  
  return Math.max(score, 0);
};
```

## Difficulty Levels

| Level | Grid Size | Pairs | Ideal Moves | Time Bonus | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Beginner | 2×2 | 2 | 4 | 15s | Easy introduction |
| Novice | 4×2 | 4 | 8 | 30s | Easy-Medium challenge |
| Intermediate | 4×4 | 8 | 16 | 60s | Medium difficulty |
| Advanced | 6×6 | 18 | 36 | 120s | Hard challenge |
| Expert | 8×8 | 32 | 64 | 240s | Very hard mastery |
